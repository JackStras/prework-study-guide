# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a way for me to keep notes of what I have learned, and its creation was also the means for me to learn basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Git.

The study guide lists the topics that we learned in our prework, and contains important notes on those topics. By opening the DevTools console on the webpage, you will be able to see the JavaScript code running, which lists the topics learned in the prework, and will select a topic at random to study.
